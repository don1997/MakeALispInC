# Project Log

## init commit
Tried to start out the inital project with multiple structs as the data structure to be used. However I prefer just having one
struct with others contained in it within a union. So on to my second commit I removed everything and redesigned the structs and 
removed most of the functions built around the other idea and will try building up the project from there.

## Second log entry 
Technically the third real main log entry but anyways this is the first real version of the second iteration. Managed to get my
program to be able to actually read a single number and determine if its a number then make it into an actual lisp object or to make it an error.

## third log entry
After this I added an eval function which essentially does nothing and refactored the code by removing all uneeded comments 
and the commented out read section.
