# Project Log

## init commit
Tried to start out the inital project with multiple structs as the data structure to be used. However I prefer just having one
struct with others contained in it within a union. So on to my second commit I removed everything and redesigned the structs and 
removed most of the functions built around the other idea and will try building up the project from there.
